# Windows shim for gltest direct mode
#
# gltest's direct-mode loader injects the transaction message by writing it to
# a temp file, dup2-ing that file onto fd 0, and then immediately unlinking the
# path. On POSIX the unlink succeeds because the descriptor keeps the inode
# alive. Windows refuses to unlink a file that still has an open handle, so
# every direct-mode deploy raises PermissionError (WinError 32).
#
# We let the unlink fail quietly and sweep the leaked temp files at exit. This
# is a host-platform workaround, not a contract concern -- on Linux and macOS
# this block is skipped entirely and gltest runs unmodified.
